## Tasks
- Study the modeling of software architectures using function blocks in IEC 61499.
- Review existing timing analysis techniques for IEC 61499-based systems.
- Develop a method for extracting end-to-end timing models from IEC 61499-based architectures.
- Apply the extracted models to perform end-to-end data-propagation delay analysis.
- Evaluate the method using industry-inspired use cases.
- Document the methodology, results, findings, and conclusions in a thesis report.
